abstract = {As with any engineering discipline, software development requires a measurement mechanism for feedback and evaluation. Measurement is a mechanism for creating a corporate memory and an aid in answering a variety of questions associated with the enactment of any software process. It helps support project planning (e.g., How much will a new project cost?); it allows us to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current processes and products (e.g., What is the frequency of certain types of errors?); it provides a rationale for adopting/refining techniques (e.g., What is the impact of the technique XX on the productivity of the projects?); it allows us to evaluate the quality of specific processes and products (e.g., What is the defect density in a specific system after deployment?). Measurement also helps, during the course of a project, to assess its progress, to take corrective action based on this assessment, and to evaluate the impact of such action.},

abstract = {Context: Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor reflecting technical compromises that can yield short-term benefit but may hurt the long-term health of a software system. Objective: This work aims at collecting studies on TD and TD management (TDM), and making a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, to obtain a comprehensive understanding on the TD concept and an overview on the current state of research on TDM. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on TD and its management, covering publications between 1992 and 2013. Results: Ninety-four studies were finally selected. TD was classified into 10 types, 8 TDM activities were identified, and 29 tools for TDM were collected. Conclusions: The term "debt" has been used in different ways by different people, which leads to ambiguous interpretation of the term. Code-related TD and its management have gained the most attention. There is a need formore empirical studieswith high-quality evidence on thewhole TDM process and on the application of specific TDM approaches in industrial settings. Moreover, dedicated TDM tools are needed for managing various types of TD in the whole TDM process.},

Specifically, we test the general hypothesis: classes with code smells are not more change prone than other classes. We detect 29 code smells in 9 releases of Azureus and in 13 releases of Eclipse, and study the relation between classes with these code smells and class change-proneness. We show that, in almost all releases of Azureus and Eclipse, classes with code smells are more change-prone than others, and that specific smells are more correlated than others to change-proneness. These results justify a posteriori previous work on the specification and detection of code smells and could help focusing quality assurance and testing activities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. An important parameter in deciding to eliminate technical debt (TD) is the probability of a module to generate interest along software evolution. In this study, we explore code smells, which according to practitioners are the most commonly occurring type of TD in industry, by assessing the associated interest probability. As a proxy of smell interest probability we use the frequency of smell occurrences and the change proneness of the modules in which they are identified. To achieve this goal we present a case study on 47,751 methods extracted from two well-known open source projects. The results of the case study suggest that: (a) modules in which "code smells" are concentrated are more change-prone than smell-free modules, (b) there are specific types of "code smells" that are concentrated in the most change-prone modules, and (c) interest probability of code clones seems to be higher than the other two examined code smells. These results can be useful for both researchers and practitioners, in the sense that the former can focus their research on resolving "code smells" that produce more interest, and the latter can improve accordingly the prioritization of their repayment strategy and their training.},

@article{Fowler1999,
abstract = {As the application of object technology-particularly the Java programming language-has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process. With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay. In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.},

However, estimating the interest payments at a similar level of detail is a manual process relying on developers to submit their estimates as they encounter instances of technical debt. We propose a framework that continuously estimates interest payments using code comprehension metrics produced by a tool that monitors developer activities in the Integrated Development Environment.
