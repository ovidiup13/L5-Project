\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item General description of the problem, motivation, relevance
  \item Brief description of experimental setup 
  \item Research questions
  \item Section descriptions
\end{enumerate}

% The precise structure of an MSci paper is not mandated, but it should
% probably cover in detail the following aspects of the project.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item General description of the problem, motivation, relevance
% \item Background information, possibly including a literature survey
% \item Description of approach taken to solve the problem, including
%   high-level design and lower-level implementation details as appropriate
% \item Evaluation, qualitative or quantitative as appropriate
% \item Conclusion, including scope for future work
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
\label{results}

Graphs are always good. I recommend getting to grips with Matlab, R or
gnuplot rather than exporting horribly Excel bitmapped graphs.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

Discuss the results and limitations to the experiment.

\subsection{Threats to validity}
\label{validity}

Risks to the methods of extraction, calculation and aggregation of technical
debt, work effort, ticket complexity, etc.
