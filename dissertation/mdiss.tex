\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item General description of the problem, motivation, relevance
  \item Contributions to state of the art 
  \item Research questions
  \item Section descriptions
\end{enumerate}

% The precise structure of an MSci paper is not mandated, but it should probably
% cover in detail the following aspects of the project. \begin{enumerate} \item
% General description of the problem, motivation, relevance \item Background
% information, possibly including a literature survey \item Description of
% approach taken to solve the problem, including high-level design and
% lower-level implementation details as appropriate \item Evaluation,
% qualitative or quantitative as appropriate \item Conclusion, including scope
% for future work \end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{background}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item literature review (a bit more compressed compared to proposal)

\subsection{Experimental Design}
\label{experimental-design}

Describe a high level design of the experimental setup.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe the data sources to be aggregated e.g. issue tracker, version
  control, static analysis
  \item Describe the criteria for data candidates selection
  \item Data gathering process design
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data collection}
\label{data-collection}

Describe the data model and low level implementation details of the data
collection process.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Discuss the data model with entities such as repository, commit, issue,
  bug, etc. 
  \item Discuss the data gathering process. What fields were gathered? What is
  the difference between Github issues and Jira issues?
  \item Mention data sources, tools, optimisations for data candidates
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data processing}
\label{data-processing}

Describe the data processing implementation details for calculating technical
debt, work effort using both commits and tickets.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Calculation of work effort: using commit timestamps and ticket timestamps.
  \item Calculation of technical debt: added, removed, total pain.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\label{results}

Provide the results of the data processing step. Aggregate the data into tables
based on the repositories chosen and provide a couple of example graphs.

\subsection{Threats to validity}
\label{validity}

Risks to the methods of extraction, calculation and aggregation of technical
debt, work effort, ticket complexity, etc.
