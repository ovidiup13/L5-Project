\section{Methodology}
\label{methodology}

In this paper, we present an approach for aggregating development team data
sources such as project management tools, version control logs and static
analysis results to produce a timeline of technical debt and work effort over
the evolution of a software product. Our motivation is to empirically find a
correlation between technical debt and the amount of work effort involved in
development of work items. In the absence of work tracking information,
aggregation of such data sources might provide a relatively accurate estimation
of the number of hours a developer has put in.

When developing our approach, we completed the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Designing an initial data model.
  \item Selecting data candidates (projects) that satisfy specific criteria.
  \item Collecting data from issue tracker, version control logs and generating
  static analysis output.
  \item Processing and refining data for analysis. 
\end{enumerate}

Section \ref{experimental-design} dives into the data model while section
\ref{data-selection} describes the data candidates criteria and selected
projects. The data collection process is described in Section
\ref{data-collection} while the calculation of work effort and technical debt is
described in Section \ref{data-processing}.

\subsection{Experimental Design}
\label{experimental-design}

The initial step was to design a model of the aggregated data and to understand
what type of information each selected data source will provide. We consider the
following data sources relevant to the collection of data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{Version Control System} is a system that manages changes to the
  source code. As work items are implemented, the system logs all changes made
  by the development team. The most popular version control tool is Git
  \emph{REFERENCE}. GitHub \emph{REFERENCE} and BitBucket \emph{REFERENCE} are
  hosting services for source code management.

  \item \emph{Project Management Tools} are software systems that help teams
  track, manage and collaborate on various types of units of work. A common
  example of a complex project management tool is Jira \emph{REFERENCE}. GitHub
  and BitBucket also provide an issue tracking tool with each code repository,
  although they do not provide such extensive features as Jira.
  
  \item \emph{Static Analysis Tools} are tools that analyse the source code to
  check for quality issues, security flaws and adherence to industry
  standards.There are many examples of static analysis tools: SonarQube,
  Spotbugs (formerly Findbugs), CAST, Sonargraph, etc.

\end{itemize}

All the data sources contain detailed information related to the set of changes
that the source code has suffered, the requirement that the developer is working
on and the possible quality issues she will encounter during implementation. In
many cases, these systems have been implemented by different producers and thus
are generally ``separated''. Therefore, data must be collected from each system,
in isolation. However, forms of ``light integrations'' exists for development
productivity purposes such as linking of work items to change-sets by specifying
the work item ID in the change-set description message. Such provide guidance on
how many change-sets the source code has suffered during the implementation of a
work item.

\subsubsection*{Version Control}
\label{version-control}

The version control system keeps track and logs all changes that a source code
has suffered over the evolution of the product. Such logs are indispensable
because they provide detailed information on the work item associated with the
change. If the system allows integrations with project management tools, then
changes can be directly linked to the appropriate work item.

Git \emph{REFERENCE} is a popular version control tool that tracks changes of
the source code using branches and commits. A branch is a ``development line''
and each project has at least one main development branch, commonly named
\emph{master}. The branch contains a stream of small units of work, called
commits, which are the snapshots of the source code at a particular point in
time. Additionally, each commit contains relevant metadata with the following
fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Object ID - is the identifier of the snapshot;
  \item Author - the name (or username) of the developer that committed the
  change;
  \item Message - a short description of the change-set;
  \item Timestamp - the time when the commit was created;
  \item Diff - the set of changes that the source code has suffered, when
  compared to the previous commit. 
\end{itemize}

For a project managed using Git, all the metadata can be easily retrieved and
snapshots can be accessed at any time. This makes Git a powerful tool in
studying the history of changes of a software product.

\subsubsection*{Project Management}
\label{project-management}

A report of the work item is represented in the form of a \emph{ticket} and
contains information on its status, assignee, complexity, deadlines, comments
and many more. The metadata of the ticket may contain other information such
as status transition timestamps, which gives an estimate of the time when a
work item has started and finished.

\subsubsection*{Static Analysis}
\label{static-analysis}

The output of static analysis tools are generally weaknesses and bugs that may
lead to vulnerabilities of the product. These weaknesses are the ``lowest
level'' of technical debt and the ones which developers have to encounter
daily \emph{REFERENCE}. Therefore, the output of analysis tools is vital to
the calculation of technical debt.

Although static analysis tools provide an approximate measure of the quality of
the code base, there is a danger in associating technical debt with their
output. As mentioned in section \ref{background}, numerous types of technical
debt exist that could impact the development effort of a work item. For example,
static analysis tools cannot predict that the requirements gathering phase was
not completed appropriately.

\subsection{Data collection}
\label{data-collection}

Describe the data model and low level implementation details of the data
collection process.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Discuss the data model with entities such as repository, commit, issue,
  bug, etc. 
  \item Discuss the data gathering process. What fields were gathered? What is
  the difference between Github issues and Jira issues?
  \item Mention data sources, tools, optimisations for data candidates
\end{enumerate}

% intro
In this case, some of the data sources are distributed and use
different underlying technologies whereas others must be generated if non
existent. Data is queried from these remote systems and aggregated into a single
source of truth.

% conclusion
Furthermore, to understand the correlation between work effort
and technical debt we process the data further, as explained in Section
\ref{data-processing}.
