abstract = {The concept of technical debt provides an excellent tool for describing technology gaps in terms any stakeholder can understand. The technical debt metaphor was pioneered by the software development community and describes technical challenges in that context very well. However, establishing a definitional framework which describes issues affecting quality more broadly will better align to stakeholder perspectives. Building on the existing concept in this way will enable technology stakeholders by providing a centralized technical debt model. The metaphor can then be used to consistently describe quality challenges anywhere within the technical environment. This paper lays the foundation for this conceptual model by proposing a definitional framework that describes how technology gaps affect all aspects of quality.},

abstract = {Technical debt is a term that has been used to describe the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during its development. Much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short-term gain for a longer-term cost. However, in the context of enterprise software development, such a model may be too narrow. We explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage, allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn't otherwise afford. We test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise, and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage. We find that in many cases, the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects, but rather by non-technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn't previously visible. We conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise-scale circumstances.},

abstract = {Technical debt is a metaphor describing situations where developers accept sacrifices in one dimension of development (e.g. software quality) in order to optimize another dimension (e.g. implementing necessary features before a deadline). Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. What has not yet been understood is the impact design debt has on the quality of a software product. Answering this question is important for understanding how growing debt affects a software product and how it slows down development, e.g. though introducing rework such as fixing bugs. In this case study we investigate how design debt, in the form of god classes, affects the maintainability and correctness of software products by studying two sample applications of a small-size software development company. The results show that god classes are changed more often and contain more defects than non-god classes. This result complements findings of earlier research and suggests that technical debt has a negative impact on software quality, and should therefore be identified and managed closely in the development process.},

An approach is proposed to quantify debts (cost to fix technical quality issues) and interest (extra cost spent on maintenance due to technical quality issues). Our approach is based on an empirical assessment method of software quality developed at the Software Improvement Group (SIG). The core part of the technical debt calculation is constructed on the basis of empirical data of 44 systems that are currently being monitored by SIG.

abstract = {Delivering increasingly complex software-reliant systems demands better ways to manage the long-term effects of short-term expedients. The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a "debt": on which "interest" has to be paid and which the "principal" should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. Therefore, we propose managing technical debt as a part of the future research agenda for the software engineering field.},

abstract = {Technical debt is the technical work developers owe a system, typically caused by speeding up development, e.g. before a software release. Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. Up until now, code smell detection has been used to help point to components that need to be freed from debt by refactoring. To date, a number of methods have been described for finding code smells in a system. However, typical debt properties, such as the value of the debt and interest rate to be paid, have not been well established. This position paper proposes an approach to using cost/benefit analysis to prioritize technical debt reduction work by ranking the value and interest of design debt caused by god classes. The method is based on metric analysis and software repository mining and is demonstrated on a commercial software application at a mid-size development company. The results are promising: the method helps to identify which refactoring activities should be performed first because they are likely to be cheap to make yet have significant effect, and which refactorings should be postponed due to high cost and low payoff.},

abstract = {Technical debt is the trading of long-term software quality in favor of short-term expediency. While the concept has traditionally been applied to tradeoffs at the code and architecture phases, it also manifests itself in the system requirements analysis phase. Little attention has been paid to requirements over time in software: requirements are often badly out of synch with the implementation, or not used at all. However, requirements are the ultimate validation of project success, since they are the manifestation of the stakeholder's desires for the system. In this position paper, we define technical debt in requirements as the distance between the implementation and the actual state of the world. We highlight how a requirements modeling tool, RE-KOMBINE, makes requirements, domain constraints and implementation first-class concerns. RE-KOMBINE represents technical debt using the notion of optimal solutions to a requirements problem. We show how this interpretation of technical debt may be useful in deciding how much requirements analysis is sufficient.},

@article{Bohnet2011,
abstract = {Software development projects are difficult to manage, in general, due to the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of code quality to ensure maintainability of the system in the future. A major challenge of this optimization problem is that code quality is less visible to stakeholders in the development process, particularly, to the management. In this paper, we describe an approach for automated software analysis and monitoring of both quality-related code metrics and development activities by means of software maps. A software map represents an adaptive, hierarchical representation of software implementation artifacts such as source code files being organized in a modular hierarchy. The maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics; they can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates. The maps aim at supporting decision-making processes. For example, they facilitate to decide where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems. Due to their high degree of expressiveness and their instantaneous generation, the maps additionally serve as up-to-date information tools, bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument. The software map concept and its tool implementation are evaluated by means of two case studies on large industrially developed software systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

The report contains our initial findings based on ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews. The goal is to identify the best practices regarding managing technical debt so that the researchers and the practitioners can further evaluate these practices to extend their knowledge of the technical debt metaphor. We determined that the developers considered their own taxonomy of technical debt based on the type of work they were assigned and their personal understanding of the term. Despite management's high-level categories, the developers mostly considered design debt, testing debt and defect debt. In addition to developers having their own taxonomy, assigning dedicated teams for technical debt reduction and allowing other teams about 20{\%} of time per sprint for debt reduction are good initiatives towards lowering technical debt. While technical debt has become a well-regarded concept in the Agile community, further empirical evaluation is needed to assess how to properly apply the concept for various development organizations.},

This study conducts a survey on industry practitioners to discover what is their level of technical debt knowledge, how does technical debt manifest in their projects and which of the applied components of agile software development -- both processes and practices -- are sensitive to technical debt. This paper contributes to the technical debt discussion by showing differences in assumed and indicated technical debt knowledge. Furthermore, components closest to implementation and its maintenance are perceived to have the most positive effects on technical debt management. Finally, the most encountered instances of technical debt are caused by architectural inadequacies, they are internal legacy, and increase in size as a result of continued implementation.},
