\section{Background Survey}
\subsection{Definition}

\subsubsection{MTD 2010 - Managing Technical Debt in Software Reliant Systems} \cite{Brown2010}
\begin{itemize}
\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
The paper proposes a research agenda for the future of software engineering field. 
It will allow developers, architects, managers and stakeholders to gain an edge in delivering high quality software without incurring any additional costs that come with the recurring interests of technical debt. 
Using appropriate practices and tools, a complex aspect such as technical debt may be managed in a straightforward way. 
\item What was the methodology? \\
This was the first seminar of technical debt, in which numerous researchers brainstormed ideas for a few days and came up with an initial definition of technical debt, its properties and challenges.
\item What were the conclusions? \\
The participants enumerated supposed properties of technical debt: value, visibility, present value, debt accretion, environment, origin of debt â€“ intentional or unintentional, impact of debt.
Additionally, they have set up a few initial research questions for further study:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to assess the impact of TD quantitatively?
	\item How to continously analize the structure of a project?
	\item Which sources of debt are dominant, intentional or unintentional?
	\item What is the cost of elimination? What are the visible consequences of holding on to that debt? What is the interest amount?
	\item How can TD can be characterized in the context of decision making?
	\item What are the appropriate toolings for quantifying and monitoring technical debt?
	\item When is it appropriate to refactor and when to implement new features?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Debt from a Stakeholder\'s Perspective} \cite{Theodoropoulos2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
		To create a definition of technical debt that better aligned with stakeholder interests and to bridge the technical gap between technology team and stakeholdes when managing software quality.
	\item What was the methodology?
		This was a position paper, no methodology has been defined.
	\item What did the authors learn?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Stakeholders generally care little about software quality, unless it is directly impacting their costs at the present time.
			\item Software quality characteristics are interdependent, deferring quality maintenance in one area may affect other areas of quality. For example, deferring work within UX may impact usability and require users to find workarounds. Additionally, inadequate validation of data at one layer may affect downstream processes.
			\item They provided a definition of technical debt, as follows: \textit{Technical debt is any gap within the technology infrastructure or its implementation which has a material impact on the required level of quality.}
			\item An interesting idea was that technical debt should only be associated with costs within technology environment rather than business and process environment. Thus the term \textbf{technical} debt.

\subsubsection{An Enterprise Perspective on Technical Debt} \cite{Klinger2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	To challenge Ward Cunningham's definition of technical debt from an enterprise perspective and define it as a strategic tool for business circumstances.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	Interviewed four technical architects from IBM, from a "wide range" of projects within the firm. Each interview was approx. 1 hour in length. 
	The questions tapped into their own experiences with TD, more specifically: nature and context, stakeholders, benefits, documentation, whether the debt was repaid. 
	\item What did the authors learn? \\
	Enterprises may use debt as a tool for maximizing competitive advantage, which may or may not be paid in the future dependant on the direction in which the project will take.
	Additionally, many stakeholders are involved in the accrual of debt in a software project (decisions are made collectively, not in a vacuum) but sometimes technical decisions would be made ad-hoc with no definite formal process.
	However, the challenge is in the collective - it is difficult to understand the socio-technical background of a system. \\
	
	Some stakeholders do not comprehend the extent of technical debt they are incurring in the system through their decisions due to: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No vocabulary between technical architects and non-technical stakeholders.
		\item Stakeholders having competing goals and "win" conditions which may be "suboptimal from a technical perspective".
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurement}

\subsubsection{The SQALE Method for Measuring Technical Debt} \cite{Letouzey2012}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
		The goal of this paper was to propose a standardized, language-agnostic framework for assessing the quality of source code by deriving measures for important code characteristics and calculating technical debt.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
		The framework proposed consisted of four concepts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Quality Model - defines internal properties of code through a structured three-layer hierarchy (characteristic, sub-characteristic and requirement).
			\item Analysis Model - measurement of the distance between the current state of the application and the \"optimized\" state, the quality target.
			\item Indices - each characteristic of the Quality Model defines a remediation index (cost to repair the non-compliances) defined in time, work or capital units.
			\item Indicators - provide a visual representation of technical debt either through ratings (ratios between TD and development cost) or SQALE Pyramids (distribution of TD over all the characteristics).
		\end{itemize}
	\item What did the authors learn?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each organization must manage technical debt as early as possible in a project with indicators and dashboards for code quality available for each build within the continous integration pipeline.
			\item Quality model must be calibrated according to the requirements and policies of the organization implementing the framework. For example, to approve/decline rules that are considered debt and what principal costs are for each type of code violation.
			\item One limitation is that the framework does not take into consideration other types of technical debt such as requirements debt, operational debt.
			\item There is no standardized definition of right code, organizations have to define their own \"right\" code rules.

\subsubsection{An Empirical Model of Technical Debt and Interest}  \cite{Nugroho2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	The goal was to formally define technical debt and interest to provide insights on the Return On Investment (ROI) of IT executives. 
	Specifically, it tried to answer the following questions from a financial perspective: How large is TD? How much interest are paying? What are the consequences of holding on to debt?
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	The authors had completed an empirical analysis of 44 projects within the Software Improvement Group (SIG) using TUViT software quality assessment method for collecting relevant metrics: lines of code, code duplications, etc.
	The had also defined technical debt as being the changes needed to bring a system from its current quality state to the "ideal" quality. This can be quantified as the repair effort (RE) and can be calculated as follows:
	RE = Rework Fraction (LOC need to be changed) * Rebuild Value (estimate in man-months of rebuilding with a particular technology) * Refactoring Adjustment (advanced tooling helping the team be more productive.)\\
	The interest was also derived from the extra cost spent on maintainance per month and per year, modelled against the quality factor (the current state of quality within the system). 
	\item What did the authors learn?
	Maintainance was considered a different activity by the authors since the tasks involved in maintaining a system involve a change that is immediately visible from the outside.
	However, technical debt repair was not considered a maintainance activity.
	A few limitations of this approach were the level of precision rating of a system (quality ratings are on a scale of 1-5) which leads to less accurate estimations on important financial numbers such as ROI.
	Refactoring adjustment variable is subjective as it requires expert input when considering development productivity.

\subsubsection{Investigating the Impact of Design Debt on Software Quality} \cite{Zazworka2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	To investigate the impact God classes have on development and whether they are points of major changes and defects when compared to other parts of the system. Additionally, to study whether there is a linear relationship between class size, change and defect likelihoods and how the results are influenced by data normalizations

	\item What was the methodology?
	The authors ran an analysis on two medium-sized projects from a small development company. The analysis consisted of statically analysing the source code stored in version control and the project issues from the project management system.
	It looked at two major variables:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Change likelihood = how likely code within and outside God classes changes accross revisions.
			\item Defect likelihood = how likely is a fix implemented inside and outside of God classes.
		\end{itemize}
	\item What did the authors learn?
	Empirical analysis of the two projects has shown that God classes get changed 7.8\% of the time whilst also being fixed 17 times more than the rest of the code.
	However, since the God classes have more functionality included, normalization of the data by LOC has shown that there are no significant results in comparing God vs non-God classes.
	The limited scope of the empirical analysis on a sample of two projects and focus on a specific code smell, the results are indecisive for a generalization of the results.

\subsection{Management}

\subsubsection{A Portfolio Approach to Managing Technical Debt} \cite{Guo2011}

\begin{itemize}
\item What were the goals of the paper?\\ 
To define technical debt from a financial portfolio perspective by encouraging to be viewed as an investment and therefore used as a strategy.
Which TD items should be paid in a release for a particular component \textit{S}?
\item What was the methodology?\\
The authors were looking at debt items in a system similar to assets in a financial portfolio, looking to maximize return on investment and minimize the risk associated with TD items.
In short, they were interested to find out whether an optimal combination of assets (TD items) can be found. \\
An approach proposed was to identify historical metrics of TD items and decide which ones to keep (the ones on which to pay interest) and which ones to sell (which to pay the principal i.e. FIX).
\item What did the authors learn? \\
Technical debt is not problematic unless the costs outweight the benefits.
The approach does not take into consideration the fact that TD items may be recklessly added to the "portfolio" and the management of undetected TD items.
Additionally, technical debt is not the same as financial debt. The amount of principal and interest are known before hand and fixed in finance whereas in software development estimation is one of the most difficult tasks.
Approach was not tested in a real setting.
