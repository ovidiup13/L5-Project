% Ward Cunningham - WyCash Portfolio Management System TODO: expand the
% definition from the paper.
Technical debt is a metaphor termed by Ward Cunningham, in his famous report on
the WyCash Portfolio Management System in 1993 \cite{Cunningham1993}. In the
report, Cunningham mentioned that "\textit{shipping first time code is like
going into debt.}" and that as the system evolves new features would become more
and more difficult to implement. This phenomenon was due to feature-rich
projects being shipped to customers early but poorly written with little or no
consideration to quality and to future work.

% MTD 2010
The metaphor was ignored for a long time, until the late 2000s, when more and
more studies started to explore the phenomenon and possible management
processes. A figure of the popularity of Technical Debt from 2004 to present can
be seen in Figure \ref{fig:td-trend}, information provided by Google Trends
\cite{GoogleTrends}. Thus, the first workshop on managing technical debt took
place in 2010, where an initial research agenda was proposed for the future of
software engineering field. Since then, workshops have been held every year,
which consisted seminars, presentations and brainstorming sessions on aspects
such as definition \cite{Kruchten2012} \cite{Theodoropoulos2011}
\cite{Schmid2013}, identification \cite{Ernst2012}, measurement
\cite{Letouzey2012} \cite{Curtis2012} \cite{Nugroho2011} \cite{Zazworka2011}

\cite{Klinger2011}.

% from metaphor to theory and practice TODO: add citation to industry case
% studies
The definition of technical debt relies heavily on the perspective of the viewer
and her responsibility within the socio-technical environment. Developers view
technical debt as a list of software quality issues and correlate it with lack
of time to implement features "\textit{properly}" \cite{Codabux2013}. Product
managers and stakeholders view at it as a strategy, a way to defer quality work
for fast work in order to satisfy certain business requirements, such as Time to
Market (TTM). In practice, these two perspectives are widely different, with
developers prioritising "invisible" code perfection whilst management focusing
on rapid development of "visible", selling point features. Kurchten et al.
\cite{Kruchten2012} defined technical debt as technological gaps between
development teams and management, where a gap is the evolution of a context
specific to a decision taken in the past. These gaps might have been decisions
that seemed correct when the decision was taken however, with the passing of
time, the initial decision incurred debt within the project. For example, there
is no tool that predicts what frameworks and languages will exist in the future
or how to implement features by considering future unknown requirements. As a
consequence, the authors state that technical debt is not the collection of code
quality violations within the results of static code analyzers but, a phenomenon
which is heavily reliant on present and future project evolution.


% from a stakeholder's perspective
However, most strategic decisions on the future evolution of the project come
from management. Unfortunately, stakeholders might not have knowledge of the
metaphor of technical debt, its current measurement and whether it impacts costs
of development. Their main focus of increasing business value through the
addition of visual features, rather than looking for investment in the quality
of the software being produced. As a result, new features are prioritised and
pressured on being delivered as early and as quickly as possible. These types of
issues affect the \textbf{extrinsic quality} of software and are "visible". For
example, an extrinsic quality characteristic is usability. Deferring user
experience work and ignoring user interface bugs might force users of the system
to find "ways around" certain tasks. The result is negative impact in user
productivity and the general usefulness of the product. Extrinsic
characteristics are important to the business as they are considered "sell
points" of the product. On the other hand, \textbf{intrinsic quality}
characteristics of software are the low-level issues such as code smells,
best-practices violations that might slow down development of new features
unless refactoring processes are applied. Theodoropoulos et al.
\cite{Theodoropoulos2011} considered that intrinsic and extrinsic software
quality characteristics are interdependent and deferring quality maitainence in
one area may affect other areas of quality. For example, improper data
validation in the business logic layer of the system, may impact downstream
components, such as user interface, and produce bugs within the system.


% on the limits of td metaphor TODO: define principal and interest
Although the use of finance terms may simplify technical characteristics of
software quality in the dialogue between development teams and stakeholders, the
analogy breaks down as studied by Schimd et al. \cite{Schmid2013}. In their
study, the authors had identified shortcomings in the financial metaphor
established by Ward Cunningham \cite{Cunningham1993} and found points where it
breaks down. In the financial domain, debt is a well known arrangement between
two parties where one party borrowes a fixed amount of money from the other
party \cite{debt-investopedia}. The most well known types of debt are loans,
where the terms of the arrangement dictate that the amount of money borrowed
must be paid back in full after a fixed period of time, along with fixed
interest payments paid annually.

Schmid et al. \cite{Schmid2013} has identified three major points where the
analogy breaks down:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Unit of measurement}. In finance there is a clear unit of
	      monetary measurement through the use of international currencies. In
	      contrast, technical debt does have a standard unit of measurement
	      defined. There are many tools (TODO: add citation of paper tools
	      here) that provide a single, quantified and aggregated measure of
	      the amount of time it takes for software quality issues to be
	      resolved. Additionally, very few of these tools quantify the
	      consequences of neglecting refactoring and the improvement in
	      quality characteristics. The issue of measurement puts a dent into
	      the shared vocabulary between development and stakeholders as
	      mentioned by a number of software practioners from industry case
	      studies (TODO: add industry case study citation here).
	\item \textit{Fixed time period}. On the one hand, debt arrangements have
	      a fixed \textit{maturity date}, where the debt must be paid back. On
	      the other hand, software quality issues do not a have a time limit
	      and may be kept in the product until they are resolved. Fixing these
	      items relate to paying back the "loan" taken on their creation. Such
	      issues may never be paid back if not needed to, resulting in an
	      increased cost-value ratio.
	\item \textit{Fixed interest}. A loan arrangement additionally consists of
	      fixed interest payments measured as a percetange of the loan value,
	      paid on an annual or bi-annual basis. The interest compensates for
	      the risk taken by the lender and encourages the loanee to pay back
	      quickly as possible in order to avoid paying back too much interest.
	      In reality, there is no such thing as fixed interest dependant on a
	      single factor in technical debt. Interest is difficult to quantify
	      as a matter of principal, and the amount of interest paid after a
	      period of time depends on future work.
\end{itemize}
Under these circumstances, what is considered "good structure" or "clean code"
is also heavily influenced to future development since future decisions
influence cost impact. As a consequence, no system is \textit{debt free} and
thus fixing every code violation would be an act of gold plating. Additionally,
what is the value of paying back this debt if the product is competitive and the
customers are happy \cite{Lim2012}?

% martin fowler - td quadrants
In Martin Fowler's famous article \cite{TDMartin}, he described this type of
future debt as \textbf{inadeverted-prudent} debt. Over time, a project that was
"clean" may find that after a period of time that the initial approach taken
might not have been the best. He considered that developers learn on the job to
perfect their craft as time passes. The four quadrants refer to the types of
technical debt that one might encounter in a software project given the approach
taken by the development team. It was one of the four quandrants he defined, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:td-quandrants}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{visualisations/TD_quadrants.png}
	\caption{Martin Fowler's Technical Debt Quadrants}
	\label{fig:td-quandrants}
\end{figure}


% unhedged call option
An alternative metaphor of technical debt \cite{UnhedgedCallOption}, described
bad code using finance terms in a similar fashion, but through a different
financial intrument called a call option.
\textit{An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by
one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract
offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put)
a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price)
during a certain period of time or on a specific date (exercise date).}
\cite{option-investopedia}. A call option gives the right to buy while a put
option gives the option holder the right to sell. In software engineering, if a
feature is hacked up quickly using bad code and never touched again, then the
project had reaped the rewards. The option "was not called". However, if a new
feature were required that would be influenced by the quick and dirty work
implemented earlier, then the requirement would be more expensive to fulfill. In
this case, the option "has been called".


% conclusion
Defining software quality issues as a financial metaphor helps bridge vocabulary
shortcomings between developers and stakeholders. It helps management understand
current software development risks and encourages ways for managing these risks
as they are created. TODO: make sure to write down the exact definition As
Cunningham \cite{Cunningham1993} had written, technical debt may be used as a
strategy in order to meet business expectations however, if not repaid promptly
it could bring entire corporations to a standstill.

% types of TD
Initially, technical debt has solely focused on the internal quality issues of
systems developed. Such issues could be code smells, code violations and
duplicate or complex code. However, multiple types of debt have been
"discovered" spanning the entire socio-technical environment.

% TODO: maybe add a description for all types of debt but only focus on code
% debt
A mapping study, conducted by Li et al. \cite{Li2015}, have analysed 94 papers,
overall dating 1992-2013, and have found 10 types of technical debt being
studied: requirements debt, architectural debt, design debt, code debt, test
debt, build debt, documentation debt, infrastructure debt, versioning debt and
defect debt.

The most prominent type of debt studied was code debt, followed by test,
architectural, design and documentation debt.

% architecture debt is the worst - industrial case study
Developers of an industrial case study considered that architectural debt is the
most difficult to adress, due to complexity and change impact on project
\cite{Codabux2013}. Major architectural decisions are not taken in a vaccuum and
thus requires group meetings with other developers, software architects and
product managers. The time to reach a consensus on how to approach such changes
improve the cost of managing architectural debt.

% techical debt is "technical"
A few of the authors have considered that the metaphor of technical debt should
only apply to the low-level, internal quality characteristics such as code,
test, architectural debt rather than process gaps such as inadequate quality
assurance \cite{Theodoropoulos2011} \cite{Nugroho2011}. Thus the word
"technical". However, process gaps may negatively affect projects and incurr
technical debt as a result.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Identification and Measurement}

There are two methods for identifying technical debt within project source code:
manually found by developers during the design or implementation stages of a new
feature or automatically identified by a code quality tool that runs either in
the integrated development environment of the developer or a project-level
continous code quality tool.

There a number of authors who have studied the identification of technical debt
and its measurement through the use of static analysis tools. They scan the
source code and find various code violations, such as code smells, code
duplication, cyclomatic complexity, test coverage issues, etc. Moreover, they
can provide detailed quality reports, links to source code, custom violations
and quality thresholds.

Fontana et al. \cite{Fontana2011} had compiled an initial report on code smell
detection tools and their experience on the analysis of multiple versions of an
object-oriented Java project.


\subsubsection{The SQALE Method for Measuring Technical Debt}
\cite{Letouzey2012} The goal of this paper was to propose a standardized,
language-agnostic framework for assessing the quality of source code by deriving
measures for important code characteristics and calculating technical debt. The
framework proposed consisted of four concepts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quality Model - defines internal properties of code through a
	structured three-layer hierarchy (characteristic, sub-characteristic and
	requirement).
	\item Analysis Model - measurement of the distance between the current
	state of the application and the \"optimized\" state, the quality target.
	\item Indices - each characteristic of the Quality Model defines a
	remediation index (cost to repair the non-compliances) defined in time,
	work or capital units.
	\item Indicators - provide a visual representation of technical debt
	either through ratings (ratios between TD and development cost) or SQALE
	Pyramids (distribution of TD over all the characteristics).
\end{itemize}

Each organization must manage technical debt as early as possible in a project
with indicators and dashboards for code quality available for each build within
the continous integration pipeline. Quality model must be calibrated according
to the requirements and policies of the organization implementing the framework.
For example, to approve/decline rules that are considered debt and what
principal costs are for each type of code violation. One limitation is that the
framework does not take into consideration other types of technical debt such as
requirements debt, operational debt. There is no standardized definition of
right code, organizations have to define their own \"right\" code rules.

\subsubsection{Estimating the Size, Cost and Types of Technical Debt}
\cite{Curtis2012} Summarized the results of a study on a huge database (365M
LOC) of software projects across 10 industries. The study was language agnostic
and provided a formula for estimating the principal of TD items. Made use of
CAST's Application Intelligence platform to statically analyse source code,
using 1200 rules for good practices. The steps taken were as follows: parsing,
identify violations, aggregate results and sum up into a quality
characteristics, or \textit{health factors}. Scores from each health factor were
aggregated on a scale of 1 (high risk) to 4 (low risk). The principal was
estimated by a formula with three parameters: number of problems, time required
for each fix and the cost of fixing the issue. The authors concluded that
estimating the interest incurred by a TD item was difficult since might be
multiple hidden factors which influenced the results. The term works well with
the phenomenon since stakeholders think of software quality in terms of
business. \\
There are trade-offs of TD management from stakeholder's perspective. For
example, fixing TD items within the Robustness characteristic may lead to fewer
operational failures and higher availability of the system.

\subsubsection{An Empirical Model of Technical Debt and Interest}
\cite{Nugroho2011} The goal was to formally define technical debt and interest
to provide insights on the Return On Investment (ROI) of IT executives.
Specifically, it tried to answer the following questions from a financial
perspective: How large is TD? How much interest are paying? What are the
consequences of holding on to debt? The authors had completed an empirical
analysis of 44 projects within the Software Improvement Group (SIG) using TUViT
software quality assessment method for collecting relevant metrics: lines of
code, code duplications, etc. The had also defined technical debt as being the
changes needed to bring a system from its current quality state to the "ideal"
quality. This can be quantified as the repair effort (RE) and can be calculated
as follows: RE = Rework Fraction (LOC need to be changed) * Rebuild Value
(estimate in man-months of rebuilding with a particular technology) *
Refactoring Adjustment (advanced tooling helping the team be more productive.)\\
The interest was also derived from the extra cost spent on maintainance per
month and per year, modelled against the quality factor (the current state of
quality within the system). Maintainance was considered a different activity by
the authors since the tasks involved in maintaining a system involve a change
that is immediately visible from the outside. However, technical debt repair was
not considered a maintainance activity. A few limitations of this approach were
the level of precision rating of a system (quality ratings are on a scale of
1-5) which leads to less accurate estimations on important financial numbers
such as ROI. Refactoring adjustment variable is subjective as it requires expert
input when considering development productivity.

\subsubsection{Investigating the Impact of Design Debt on Software Quality}
\cite{Zazworka2011} To investigate the impact God classes have on development
and whether they are points of major changes and defects when compared to other
parts of the system. Additionally, to study whether there is a linear
relationship between class size, change and defect likelihoods and how the
results are influenced by data normalizations The authors ran an analysis on two
medium-sized projects from a small development company. The analysis consisted
of statically analysing the source code stored in version control and the
project issues from the project management system. It looked at two major
variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Change likelihood = how likely code within and outside God classes changes
accross revisions.
\item Defect likelihood = how likely is a fix implemented inside and outside of
God classes.
\end{itemize}
Empirical analysis of the two projects has shown that God classes get changed
7.8\% of the time whilst also being fixed 17 times more than the rest of the
code. However, since the God classes have more functionality included,
normalization of the data by LOC has shown that there are no significant results
in comparing God vs non-God classes. The limited scope of the empirical analysis
on a sample of two projects and focus on a specific code smell, the results are
indecisive for a generalization of the results.

\subsubsection{Investigating the impact of Code Smells Debt on Quality Code
Evaluation} \cite{Fontana2012}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      The goals were to study the impact on code quality metrics of
	      removing code smell, which code smell incurs the most TD and whether
	      their impact on is related to the domain of the software
	      application. Should code smells be categorized as design debt?
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The study looked at three most common smells: Data class, God class
	      and Duplicated Code. The metrics impacted are related to cohesion,
	      coupling and complexity; calculated by various tools according to
	      clarity of computation. Best refactoring practices were applied for
	      each smell detected in the system and the quality metrics have been
	      re-analysed to assess their impact.
	\item What did the authors learn? \\
	      Some code quality tools evaluate code smells through a set of rules
	      which must be customized according to the application domain of the
	      system. Refactoring of one code smell may provide benefits for one
	      or more metric qualities but may negatively impact others.
	      Additionally, code duplication is one of the worst smells but may
	      also provide benefits in some cases. Data Class smell and God class
	      smells may be domain-dependent, but this assumption heavily
	      correlates with the types of tools and libraries listed as
	      dependencies in the system.
	\item Links to other resources? \\
	      Zhang et al. investigated relationship between code smells and
	      software faults => how to prioritize refactoring.\\
	      Arcelli et al. proposed a first analysis on refactoring on a small
	      scale of software metrics.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software
Maps} \cite{Bohnet2011}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      The goal of the paper was to bridge the gap between development
	      teams and corporate managers, by exposing internal system quality
	      through the use of software maps. Software maps enable managers to
	      assess where improvement in quality is most necessary and can
	      observe future quality risk and estimate future maintenance costs.
	      Additionally, it helps developers and project managers identify
	      modules suitable for refactoring/clean-up before the start of a
	      sprint.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      A software map is a hierarchical 2D/3D view of software artefacts
	      within a project. Each artefact is represented visually through
	      properties such as colour, texture and size; each representing a
	      property of quality: cyclomatic complexity, LOC, nesting levels. The
	      authors have implemented a software for visualizing software maps
	      and evaluated the tool on two projects: JBoss and Blender.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      The authors have defined the internal quality of the system to be
	      directly correlated to the quality of the source code. These
	      qualities are invisible to customers and management, and
	      stakeholders are reluctant to put more resources into internal
	      quality. On the other hand, external quality relates to the visible,
	      discoverable qualities of the system. For example, defects and bugs
	      are two discoverable phenomenons of external quality. Impact of
	      external quality issues are immediate, and stakeholders are inclined
	      to invest in quick features/fixes that make an instant impact.
	\item What were the limitations? \\
	      The system has not been evaluated in practice.\\
	      There is no aggregation of values into a single metric that is
	      understandable by both parties.\\
	      Calculating the cost of a change is difficult, only shows the past
	      and current quality status.
	\item Links to other resources? \\

\subsection{Management}

\subsubsection{A Portfolio Approach to Managing Technical Debt} \cite{Guo2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper?\\
	      To define technical debt from a financial portfolio perspective by
	      encouraging to be viewed as an investment and therefore used as a
	      strategy. Which TD items should be paid in a release for a
	      particular component \textit{S}?
	\item What was the methodology?\\
	      The authors were looking at debt items in a system similar to assets
	      in a financial portfolio, looking to maximize return on investment
	      and minimize the risk associated with TD items. In short, they were
	      interested to find out whether an optimal combination of assets (TD
	      items) can be found. \\
	      An approach proposed was to identify historical metrics of TD items
	      and decide which ones to keep (the ones on which to pay interest)
	      and which ones to sell (which to pay the principal i.e. FIX).
	\item What did the authors learn? \\
	      Technical debt is not problematic unless the costs outweight the
	      benefits. The approach does not take into consideration the fact
	      that TD items may be recklessly added to the "portfolio" and the
	      management of undetected TD items. Additionally, technical debt is
	      not the same as financial debt. The amount of principal and interest
	      are known before hand and fixed in finance whereas in software
	      development estimation is one of the most difficult tasks. Approach
	      was not tested in a real setting.
	\item Links to other resources?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Prioritising Design Debt Investment Opportunities}
\cite{Zazworka2011Prioritise}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      Proposes an approach for making refactoring decision regarding God
	      classes in software projects, that will have a low principal cost
	      and long-term benefits.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The authors have considered the cost-benefit analysis criteria for
	      prioritization, by taking into consideration the cost of refactoring
	      and quality gained from each refactoring of TD items. The proposed
	      method approximates size of refactoring based on source code
	      complexity metrics such as Weighted Method Count, Tight Class
	      Cohesion and Access to Foreign Data Metric. A feasibility study was
	      conducted on a small size software development company on a project
	      with 35k LOC, 11 month old and mantained by a team of 4 developers.
	\item What were the limitations of the study? \\
	      There were no results related to the feasibility study. The study
	      was only conducted on a single class smell, the God class. Choice of
	      refactoring must also be evaluated by the business side.
	\item Links to other resources? \\
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Using Technical Debt Data in Decision Making} \cite{Seaman2012}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      To discuss the approaches of technical debt management and to
	      propose four novel ways to aid decision making.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      Proposed four approaches for decision making on TD:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Cost-Benefit Analysis. Defined principal, interest
		            probability (the probability that other work will be
		            more expensive) and the interest amount. Based on these
		            three factors and their associated value (high, medium,
		            low), the authors claimed it is possible to estimate
		            items that have low principal (are quick to repay) and a
		            possible high impact on future additions and changes.
		      \item Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Defined a criteria by
		      which TD items would be paid off, through group decisions.

\subsection{Industry Case Studies}

\subsubsection{What Software Practitioners have to say about TD} \cite{Lim2012}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      The goals of the study was to gather information on how
	      practitioners identify, visualize and manage technical debt in
	      industry.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The authors have had interviews with 35 practitioners with broad
	      backgrounds: various companies, a range of years of experiences,
	      positions, etc. The interview questions were both open-ended and
	      closed-ended.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      After being introduced to a definition of TD, 25\% of the
	      participants considered TD as unintentional, and the rest considered
	      that TD was caused by various trade-offs. They understood that
	      business reality forces trade-offs within software quality in order
	      to satisfy business goals. Furthermore, some practitioners mentioned
	      that their team cut back on software quality enforcement methods due
	      to time constraints and due to this TD was incurred in their
	      projects. They had to balance requirements and software quality
	      against deadlines, since customer/business demands always took
	      precedence. \\

	      However, participants have struggled to find a way to measure TD and
	      its cumulative effort over time. Moreover, convincing management to
	      invest resources in paying back TD is difficult, unless there is an
	      associated business value. Unfortunately, there was no vocabulary
	      defined between development teams and business, hence difficult to
	      explain TD and its associated costs over time. Some teams have had
	      success in convincing stakeholders of the impact of TD, by quickly
	      implementing a set of requirements and visualizing their trade-offs
	      over a period of time. As a result, they reported that stakeholders
	      were happy to negotiate extending deadlines for features due to
	      this. \\

	      The two perspectives of TD, from development to business, is
	      different. Developers are mainly interested in the perfection of the
	      code whilst management considers that time to market is of extreme
	      importance. However, developers are more aware of the impact of TD
	      over time, since they have to deal with it on a daily basis. \\

	      As a result of the study, the authors, developers and management
	      have proposed the following practices when dealing with TD:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Allocate 5-10\% of resources for each release in paying
		      back TD.
		      \item Always keep an open dialogue with the customers and
		      management on issues surrounding TD.
		      \item Make TD as visible as possible through the use of
		      documentation, static analysis tools, etc.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Searching for Build Debt} \cite{Morgenthaler2012}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      To publish enterprise approaches within Google for managing
	      technical debt in build files. This type of TD was lowering
	      developer productivity and increased the computational resources
	      within the infrastructure and thus increased costs.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The developers at Google leveraged in-door developed tools for
	      automating removal of legacy code projects no longer refenced,
	      removal of indirect dependencies between projects and removal of
	      dead command-line flags which hindered developer comprehension of
	      command line tools and processes. Teams were holding FIXIT days
	      where developers may remove and improve dead flags and dead/zombie
	      dependencies.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      Google has a very large codebase that is difficult to manage.
	      Specifically, a simple dependency change might take weeks due to
	      previous links in the dependency graphs and build files of other
	      projects that rely on it. Removal of dead code has been simplied
	      with the introduction of code visibility and health flags.
	      Additionally, one FIXIT day has removed approximately 250k lines of
	      code related to dead flags.
	\item What were the limitations? \\
	      There was only one type of TD assessed in the paper: BUILD debt.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Managing Technical Debt - An industrial case study}
\cite{Codabux2013}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      The goals of the paper was to complete an empirical analysis of
	      Agile methodologies and its effect on technical debt within a
	      mid-sized company. In particular, the authors wanted to find what
	      were the various types of TD, how to handle them, what the
	      consequences of holding on to that debt are, how TD is prioritized
	      and addressed.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The authors had 3 visits to the office of the company, each 3-day
	      long. They were part of team meetings such as sprint planning, scrum
	      and retrospectives. Interviews with both management and development
	      teams have been completed. A total of 28 members had participated to
	      the study.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      The authors had mixed responses when comparing division management
	      interviews and developers. Division management considered technical
	      debt to be of infrastructure nature (in terms of operations) and
	      testing nature (issues with test automation). Developers, on the
	      other hand, correlated TD with the lack of time to implement
	      features \textit{properly}.\\
	      However, architecture debt was considered to be the most difficult
	      to manage since it required group decisions which take time and
	      coordination. The team was taking appropriate steps to exterminate
	      TD by assigning small teams within the division solely dedicated to
	      refactoring tasks.
	\item What were the limitations? \\
	      The study was conducted with one industry partner and therefore does
	      not reflect the impact of TD within the entire Agile process.
	      Additionally, interviews were not recorded and responses may be
	      subject to bias of the interviewer.

\subsubsection{Technical Debt and its Effects on Agile Management Practice}
\cite{Holvitie2014}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      To study technical debt within the agile management process and its
	      impact.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      The study consisted of three sections of research questions which
	      covered background information and TD knowledge level, agile
	      processes affecting TD and singular instances of TD. Data collection
	      was completed through an anonymous online form sent to 507
	      individuals spanning more than 150 companies. The survey consisted
	      of 34 questions open and closed-ended and took approximately 10
	      minutes to complete.
	\item What were the conclusions? \\
	      80\% of the individuals have heard of technical debt before and
	      considered to have a good knowledge on it. Of their entire day, TD
	      was discussed most in work meetings while only 35\% of the responses
	      have applied refactorings related to TD.\\
	      50\% of the participants considered practices such as simple design,
	      TDD, following code standards, continous integration, collective
	      ownership and pair programming to have a positive effect on TD.
	      Additionally, of all the meetings, retrospectives have been
	      considered as most influential to TD by 50\% of the responses.
	      However, phases such as requirements gathering, design and
	      implementation had been considered to incur the most TD.
	\item What were the limitations? \\
	      The study was conducted online anonymously - no way to understand
	      how many sectors, how many companies and teams have been involved in
	      the responses.\\
	      Limited to the country of the authors - Finland.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{An Enterprise Perspective on Technical Debt} \cite{Klinger2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
	      To challenge Ward Cunningham's definition of technical debt from an
	      enterprise perspective and define it as a strategic tool for
	      business circumstances.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
	      Interviewed four technical architects from IBM, from a "wide range"
	      of projects within the firm. Each interview was approx. 1 hour in
	      length. The questions tapped into their own experiences with TD,
	      more specifically: nature and context, stakeholders, benefits,
	      documentation, whether the debt was repaid.
	\item What did the authors learn? \\
	      Enterprises may use debt as a tool for maximizing competitive
	      advantage, which may or may not be paid in the future dependant on
	      the direction in which the project will take. Additionally, many
	      stakeholders are involved in the accrual of debt in a software
	      project (decisions are made collectively, not in a vacuum) but
	      sometimes technical decisions would be made ad-hoc with no definite
	      formal process. However, the challenge is in the collective - it is
	      difficult to understand the socio-technical background of a system.
	      \\

	      Some stakeholders do not comprehend the extent of technical debt
	      they are incurring in the system through their decisions due to:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item No vocabulary between technical architects and
		      non-technical stakeholders.
		      \item Stakeholders having competing goals and "win" conditions
		      which may be "suboptimal from a technical perspective".

\section{Proposed Approach}

Goal-Question-Metric approach is a good framework for breaking down research
work. (TODO: add citation here)

Goal-Question-Metric approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: \textbf{Analyze} project feature implementations \textbf{with
	the purpose of} identifying extra work \textbf{from the viewpoint of}
	software engineers and project manager \textbf{in the context of}
	technical debt management.
	\item RQ1: Can technical debt interest for a team be predicted for each
	sprint?
	\item RQ1.1: What was the difference (delta) in the estimated work effort
	for a feature and the practical work effort due to technical debt?
	\item RQ1.2: What is the measurement of TD in the affected modules across
	change sets?
	\item RQ1.3: How does work effort delta vary with the magnitude of
	technical debt?
	\item RQ2: What are the development patterns surrounding feature
	lifecycle?
	\item RQ2.2: At what checkpoint in development is technical debt reduction
	(refactoring)  most prominent?
\end{itemize}

Possible approach: 1) Identify appropriate data candidates for this study. These
are a mixture of open source and enterprise software. 2) Identify suitable work
items from project planning software. 3) Retrieve work items from issue tracker.
4) Identify checkpoints in project codebase which are appropriate to the
selected work items. 5) Analyze work effort of selected work items. 6) Analyze
measurement of technical debt in change sets. 7) Analysis and discussion of
results.

Risks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data candidates may not contain enough relevant information in
	project management software, such as priority and story points.
	\item Work effort estimation is difficult in the context of open source
	systems. What is the metric for quantifying work effort?
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Time - theoretically used in Agile process through
		            metrics such as story points. Must be careful on how it
		            is quantified since there may be many outliers.
		      \item Change sets - the amount of lines of code added and
		            removed of a work item. Possible outliers are due to
		            refactoring: remove, add, copy, etc. This issue is
		            further emphasized by diversity of refactoring tools
		            available in modern IDEs.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Technical debt is not a standardized metric and various tools
	calculate TD with a different formula and take into account multiple types
	of debt.
	\item Granularity of code checkpoints is important. These may be: commit
	level, branch level, pull request level, release level.
