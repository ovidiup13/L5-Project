\subsection{The SQALE Method for Measuring Technical Debt} \cite{Letouzey2012}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
		The goal of this paper was to propose a standardized, language-agnostic framework for assessing the quality of source code by deriving measures for important code characteristics and calculating technical debt.
	\item What was the methodology? \\
		The framework proposed consisted of four concepts:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Quality Model - defines internal properties of code through a structured three-layer hierarchy (characteristic, sub-characteristic and requirement).
			\item Analysis Model - measurement of the distance between the current state of the application and the \"optimized\" state, the quality target.
			\item Indices - each characteristic of the Quality Model defines a remediation index (cost to repair the non-compliances) defined in time, work or capital units.
			\item Indicators - provide a visual representation of technical debt either through ratings (ratios between TD and development cost) or SQALE Pyramids (distribution of TD over all the characteristics).
		\end{itemize}
	\item What did the authors learn?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each organization must manage technical debt as early as possible in a project with indicators and dashboards for code quality available for each build within the continous integration pipeline.
			\item Quality model must be calibrated according to the requirements and policies of the organization implementing the framework.
			\item One limitation is that the framework does not take into consideration other types of technical debt such as requirements debt, operational debt.
			\item There is no standardized definition of right code, organizations have to define their own \"right\" code rules.
		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Debt from a Stakeholder\'s Perspective} \cite{Theodoropoulos2011}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What were the goals of the paper? \\
		To create a definition of technical debt that better aligned with stakeholder interests and to bridge the technical gap between technology team and stakeholdes when managing software quality.
	\item What was the methodology?
		This was a position paper, no methodology has been defined.
	\item What did the authors learn?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Stakeholders generally care little about software quality, unless it is directly impacting their costs at the present time.
			\item Software quality characteristics are interdependent, deferring quality maintenance in one area may affect other areas of quality. For example, deferring work within UX may impact usability and require users to find workarounds. Additionally, inadequate validation of data at one layer may affect downstream processes.
			\item They provided a definition of technical debt, as follows: \textit{Technical debt is any gap within the technology infrastructure or its implementation which has a material impact on the required level of quality.}
			\item An interesting idea was that technical debt should only be associated with costs within technology environment rather than business and process environment. Thus the term \textbf{technical} debt. 
			\end{itemize}
